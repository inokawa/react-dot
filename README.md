React component to render customizable graph/diagram.

There are many great ways in JavaScript to create graphs/diagrams, like [mermaid](https://github.com/mermaid-js/mermaid), [JointJS](https://www.jointjs.com/), [@hpcc-js/wasm](https://github.com/hpcc-systems/hpcc-js-wasm#graphviz-graphvizlibwasm) and so on.
However it's difficult to create our own customized UI and update it in data-driven way.
This was made to solve it.

**This is under development.**
